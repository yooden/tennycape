The name Tennycape was created (or rather found) by going through a list of
Candadian rivers and pick one that sounded nice and memorable. That method
was inspired by the deceased German role playing game club "252". 252 got
its name by pointing to a map of Scotland, ending up on a elevation
inscription. That method was apparently used by some author before that,
but I don't know his name.

Tennycape is a river in Nova Scotia, Canada, near a small settlement of the
same name.

Tennycape's working title was "River", in anticipation of the name-finding
method used eventually.
