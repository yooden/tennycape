Some principles:

- Tennycape should remain tool-agnostic. Git works fine, but one day
  something better will come along. Tennycape should not depend on a
  particular feature of Git or another tool, or worse, on its internals.

- Tennycape should be black-start-capable. That means that in the case of a
  catastrophic server failure we should be able to re-create Tennycape
  (including its database) on a new machine in a quick and straightforward
  way.
