Some principles:

- River should remain tool-agnostic. Git works fine, but one day something
  better will come along. River should not depend on a particular feature
  of a tool, or worse, on its internals.

- River should be black-start-capable. That means that in the case of a
  catastrophic failure we should be able to re-create River (including its
  database) on a new machine in a quick and  straightforward way.
